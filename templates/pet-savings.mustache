		<h1>Pricey Pets:  Tips for Saving Money</h1>
		Americans will spend over $50 billion on pet care this year.  In these trying times, not all pet owners can afford to take care of their pets and still meet their financial goals.  Below are some ways in which you can cut down on costs while still providing the care your pet needs for a happy and healthy life. 
		
		<h3>Preventive Care</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Routine preventive care such as vaccinations and regular checkups are big time cost savers.  If you skip the $20 vaccination you might find yourself paying thousands of dollars for your pet’s infections.  If you’re really against paying for the vaccinations, contact your local shelter or ASPCA, sometimes they offer free preventive vaccinations and treatments
				</li>
				<li>
					Regular checkups, this isn’t up for debate and it’s important enough to mention twice.  Don’t wait until your pet is showing signs of sickness because it might be too late.  Regular checkups not only can save your pets life, they save you money by helping you avoid the much more costly care down the road. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Obesity, it’s a pet and wallet killer.  It’s hard to say no to the pet you love, especially when they make that face (you know the one I’m talking about!).  Before you give your pet that second helping, remember that obesity in pets can lead to countless chronic health issues including broken bones, ruptured discs, chronic pain, joint problems, heart disease, and diabetes.  Watch what you feed your pet and give them plenty of exercise and you’ll improve your pet’s chances of a long healthy life without lifelong medical expenses
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3>Food</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Pet Food is likely your biggest recurring expense, take advantage of bulk buying for your favorite brands or special sales when they come up.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remember that price does not equal quality.  Do your homework on the food you serve, there are many lower cost brands that will provide all the necessary nutrition your pet needs at steep discounts.   Your vet should be able to provide you with some nutrition guidance, an extra five minutes in the store will turn that knowledge into regular savings
				</li>
				<li>
					Consider joining a discount program.  You can save money on everything from pet food to pet supplies through programs like AAA , Student Advantage, or specific pet discount programs
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3>Pet Insurance</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					American’s are spending well over $13 billion on vet care each year.  Costs are expected to grow as more conditions become treatable with new sophisticated medical techniques.  If you’re the kind of Pet owner who’s going to pay to provide top notch medical care for your pet regardless of the ailment, then insurance is a must have
				</li>
				<li>
					While insurance creates an added monthly cost for a pet owner, it will protect your family from the expensive emergency care costs that can break your wallet
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3>Discount Pet Meds</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					There are many discount websites that will sell the same medication you’ve been purchasing for cheaper.  One word of caution is to make sure that site is reputable and has a license to sell in your state otherwise you might not be purchasing exactly what you ordered
				</li>
				<li>
				Surprisingly, many vets sell their medication directly to patients (but more likely owners of patients ☺) at highly competitive prices to the big box pharmacies and grocery chains.  It’s ok to compare prices before you purchase
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3>Grooming</h3>
		aka washing away your money.  While it always feels good to look good, professional bathing and grooming expenses can add up quickly if you’re not careful.  If money’s tight, try grooming your pet at home.  Some helpful tips we’ve learned include:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ask your vet to show you how to brush your pet’s teeth and clean it’s ears.   Doing both at home will save you money and help protect your pet from expensive health issues
				</li>
				<li>
					When you do get your pet’s hair trimmed, go for a shorter look.  This will make professional grooming visits less frequent (for even greater savings try doing touchups on your own)
				</li>
				<li>
					Going over your pet’s fur with a wire-bristled brush, and follow up with a steel comb once a week. This is not only good for your pet, but it will keep their coat looking great without the expense of going to a groomer
				</li>
				<li>
					There are free videos on youtube of pet grooming, learn to do it all yourself and cut out nearly all the costs!
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3>Toys, collars, and bowls, oh my!</h3>
		Don’t overspend on the frills!  Many dog owners overdo it buying stylish collars, funky bowls or buckets of toys.   Most animals don’t care what their bowl looks like, can’t look at their own collar, and just want to play with one or two toys (or frankly just the bucket).   If variety is important to you, craigslist and yard sales can supply you with many of the essentials cheaply.  For toys we suggest that instead of buying boxes of expensive $30 toys, stick to the basics.  Cat’s will gladly play with a ball of tinfoil or anything else they can bat around.  Dog’s are happy with something durable they can chew.  In our experience, the more simple the toy, the more fun the pet’s seem to have with it
